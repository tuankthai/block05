    The Wild Animal Mini-Zoo recently hired many new zookeeper interns who will work at the zoo for the next six months.  
    They have contracted a web developer team to build a page that will make it easier for the new interns to identify each animal and
    understand their needs and behaviors.

    <h2>Bears</h2>
        <section>
            <span>Bears facts:
            Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae (/ʊrsɪdaɪ/ or /ʊrsɪdiː/). They are classified as caniforms, or
            doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety
            of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the
            continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large
            bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws,
            and short tails.

    <h2>Giraffes</h2>
        <article>
            <span>Giraffes facts:
            The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal
            and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with
            nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into up to eight extant species due to new research
            into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements. Seven other extinct species of Giraffa
            are known from the fossil record.

     <h2>Lions</h2>
        <p>
            <span>Lions facts:
            Lion is a large, powerfully built cat (family Felidae) that is second in size only to the tiger. The proverbial “king of beasts,”
            the lion has been one of the best-known wild animals since earliest times. Lions are most active at night and live in a
            variety of habitats but prefer grassland, savanna, dense scrub, and open woodland. Historically, they ranged across much
            of Europe, Asia, and Africa, but now they are found mainly in parts of Africa south of the Sahara. An isolated
            population of about 650 Asiatic lions constitute a slightly smaller race that lives under strict protection in India’s
            Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary

    <h2>Monkeys</h2>
        <section>
            <span>Monkey facts:
            Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as the simians.
            Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes, which constitutes
            an incomplete paraphyletic grouping; however, in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also
            included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regards to their scope.

    <h2>Alligators</h2>
        <article>
            <span>Alligator facts:
            Adult male American alligators measure 3.4 to 4.6 m (11.2 to 15.1 ft) in length, and can weigh up to 450 kg (1,000 lb),
            with unverified sizes of up to 5.84 m (19.2 ft) and weights of 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) making it the second longest member
            of the family Alligatoridae, after the black caiman, while being the heaviest. Females are smaller, measuring 2.6 to 3 m
            (8.5 to 9.8 ft) in length.[5][6][7][8][9] The American alligator inhabits subtropical and tropical freshwater wetlands,
            such as marshes and cypress swamps, from southern Texas to North Carolina.[10] It is distinguished from the sympatric
            American crocodile by its broader snout, with overlapping jaws and darker coloration, and is less tolerant of saltwater
            but more tolerant of cooler climates than the American crocodile, which is found only in tropical and warm subtropical
            climates.
